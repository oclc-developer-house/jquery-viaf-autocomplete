Problems we ran into
====================
-Wanted more fields than autosuggest api returned, tried using search api but it only returned xml 
and we ran into cross domain ajax request problems since we are trying to do this all via javascript. Ended
up using the autosuggest api.  Here's the xml field we wanted:  <ns*:nameType>Personal</ns*:nameType>

Open Questions
==============

* can we get nameType back in autosuggest
* All about VIAF: http://inkdroid.org/journal/2012/05/15/diving-into-viaf/
* we've funnelled the following request to OCLC developer(s):
   * modify autosuggest to:
      - allow query by type
      - return type as part of jsonp return
   * modify justlinks.json for the viaf id call to include the data available in xml

New VIAF Autocomplete Endpoint from Ralph Van
=============================================

How this works
==============

In your html, you have a hidden input
<input type="hidden" id="myViafId"/>

in your $document ready, you'd do

$("#myViafId").viafautocomplete(
  {
    onSelect: function(object){}, 
    onNoMatch: function() {alert("no match");}
  }
);
