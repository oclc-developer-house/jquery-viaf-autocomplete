jquery-viaf-autocomplete
========================
### Goals

To provide an easy way to obtain the VIAF ID of an input entity through use of the VIAF endpoint.  

There are presently three widgets in this project:

  * __jquery.viafauto.extended.js__ -- *Current*: Use this by default (jQuery 1.9+; jQuery UI 10+)
  * __jquery.viafauto.js__, the core of the current version, an extension of jquery.ui.autocomplete.
  * __jquery.viaf.autocomplete.js__ -- *Legacy*: Uses, but does not extend jquery.ui.autocomplete. This is to enable developers who, for some reason can't immediately upgrade their source to the requred jQuery and jQuery UI versions.
 
The only *usage* difference between the legacy widget and the non-legacy widget is extensibility.
They both produce a "viafautox" widget.  The "extended" widget is itself a good example of the extensibility afforded by modern the jQuery widget framework.

Currently, the widgets are using the OCLC VIAF AutoSuggest API endpoint, but we may switch to using the VIAF Search endpoint as that develops better support for JSON. 
 
### Demo

To see the widget(s) in action, view the [demo pages](http://oclc-developer-house.github.io/jquery-viaf-autocomplete/).

### Requirements

* jQuery 1.9 and jQuery UI 10
* jQuery 1.6.1 and jQuery UI 1.8 (legacy)

### Usage

#### Download the source:

* Download and include src/jquery.viafauto.js and jquery.viafauto.extended.js (optional, recommended):

   See the sample implementation in [extended.html](http://oclc-developer-house.github.io/jquery-viaf-autocomplete/extended.html).
   
* For a legacy application, download and include src/jquery.viaf.autocomplete.js 
   
   See the sample implementation in [legacy.html](http://oclc-developer-house.github.io/jquery-viaf-autocomplete/legacy.html).

####  Options

Either of these widgets take any option that is valid for the appropriate version of jQuery UI's [Autocomplete Widget](http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/)
except _source_, which these widgets define.

There are two additional options:

  * _nomatch_  If defined, is a function that is triggered if no data is returned from the VIAF endpoint.
  * _noselect_ If defined, is a function that is triggered if the targeted element loses focus without the user having selected something.
  
####  Sample Usage

_Assumes there is a text box **foo** defined in the html_, like:

```html
<input type="text" id="foo"/>
```

Then invoke directly on the target jQuery element:

```javascript
$(function() {
   $("#foo").viafautox( {
       select: function(event, ui){
         var item = ui.item;
         var message = "From First Search Box: " +item.id + " " + item.value + " (type: " + item.nametype +")";
         alert(message);
       },
       nomatch: function(event.ui) {
         var val = $(event.target).val();
         alert("no match was found for " + val);
       } 
   }
});
```

### Goals

As a metadata editor I want a way to easily identify an entity so that I donâ€™t have to manually add data.

As an integrator I want modular so that it is easy to install.

### Endpoint Extensions
Long term, we'd like the search endpoint to be able to provide JSONP like autosuggest does:

```
GET http://viaf.org/viaf/search?query=local.names+all%22Neal%20Stephenson%22&callback=myFunction
Accept: application/json (or text/javascript)
```

like: 

```javascript
myFunction({
  "version": "1.1",
  "numberOfRecords": 6,
  "resultSetIdleTime": 1,
  "records": [
    { "recordSchema": "default", "recordPacking": "xml", "recordData": {...}},
    { "recordSchema": "default", "recordPacking": "xml", "recordData": {...}},
     ...
   ]
})
```

But that will involve the non-trivial conversion of SRU XML to JSON.  

Short term, we could get by with an additional field in the response from autosuggest:

```
GET http://viaf.org/viaf/AutoSuggest?query=raymond james
```

```javascript
myFunction({ 
  "query":"raymond james",
  "result":[
  {"term":"Raymond James Sontag, 1897-1972",
   "type": "Personal",
   "lc":"n85005527",    "dnb":"12708603x",
   "bne":"xx1143756",   "nla":"000035512726",
   "viafid":"42849305"},
  {"term":"Raymond James Long, 1938-",
   "type": "Personal",
   "lc":"n81079333",    "dnb":"123240638",
   "bav":"adv10021126", "bnf":"12935138",
   "viafid":"27197164"}
  ...
})
```

The "type" value should correspond to: *records > record > recordData > VIAFCluster > nameType* from the existing SRU response.  

Then the obvious next step would be to allow a query parameter to filter by the newly exposed field.  The motivation is that when you know you are looking for a geographic or corporate name or UniformTitleWork, the relevance of the most likely auto-complete entries will be zero.  In those cases, the user is quite likely to get back only the "wrong" completions until much later in the string and it is conceivable that even the complete string will still retrieve more than one page of hits of the wrong type.
