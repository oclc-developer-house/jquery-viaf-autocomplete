### Goals

As a metadata editor I want a way to easily identify an entity so that I donâ€™t have to manually add data.

As an integrator I want modular so that it is easy to install.

 
### Endpoint Extensions
Long term, we'd like the search endpoint to be able to provide JSONP like autosuggest does:

```
GET http://viaf.org/viaf/search?query=local.names+all%22Neal%20Stephenson%22&callback=myFunction
Accept: application/json (or text/javascript)
```

like: 

```javascript
myFunction({
  "version": "1.1",
  "numberOfRecords": 6,
  "resultSetIdleTime": 1,
  "records": [
    { "recordSchema": "default", "recordPacking": "xml", "recordData": {...}},
    { "recordSchema": "default", "recordPacking": "xml", "recordData": {...}},
     ...
   ]
})
```

But that will involve the non-trivial conversion of SRU XML to JSON.  

Short term, we could get by with an additional field in the response from autosuggest:

```
GET http://viaf.org/viaf/AutoSuggest?query=raymond james
```

```javascript
myFunction({ 
  "query":"raymond james",
  "result":[
  {"term":"Raymond James Sontag, 1897-1972",
   "type": "Personal",
   "lc":"n85005527",    "dnb":"12708603x",
   "bne":"xx1143756",   "nla":"000035512726",
   "viafid":"42849305"},
  {"term":"Raymond James Long, 1938-",
   "type": "Personal",
   "lc":"n81079333",    "dnb":"123240638",
   "bav":"adv10021126", "bnf":"12935138",
   "viafid":"27197164"}
  ...
})
```

The "type" value should correspond to: *records > record > recordData > VIAFCluster > nameType* from the existing SRU response.  

Then the obvious next step would be to allow a query parameter to filter by the newly exposed field.  The motivation is that when you know you are looking for a geographic or corporate name or UniformTitleWork, the relevance of the most likely auto-complete entries will be zero.  In those cases, the user is quite likely to get back only the "wrong" completions until much later in the string and it is conceivable that even the complete string will still retrieve more than one page of hits of the wrong type.
